Recently, I began reading Isaac Asimov's Foundation. Here are a few of my thoughts after my first reading of the novel.

# Isaac Asimov's Foundation
Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series is set far in the future, featuring an advanced society on the brink of collapse. Within the society, there are people called psychohistorians who study the past in order to predict the future. Hari Seldon, a prominent psychohistorian, observes that after the collapse of the empire there will likely be 30,000 centuries of “barbarism” - that is, a loss of scientific and cultural progress.

Seldon devises a plan to reduce the length of the “dark ages”, thus also the loss of cultural and scientific progress, using psychohistory. He posits that the establishment of a “Foundation” dedicated to guarding such history and leading the way for a new Galactic Empire 1000 years after the fall will be possible, given certain circumstances. 

The Foundation series is largely a retelling of the plan Seldon puts in place in order to save society, set over many centuries. The "Foundation" that Seldon establishes is meant to create order amidst the decay of the Galactic Empire using superior scientific knowledge, prevailing over many political challenges using advanced technology. The novel is organized into five unit texts, each a separate short story set within the same timeline.

## Nuclear Power in Foundation
Foundation was published in 1951, shortly after the end of World War 2. As an American Jew who was alive and cognizant at the time, Asimov was horrified by the barbaric cruelty displayed by the Axis powers. He has described the writing of Foundation as an outlet for such horror in the years following the war - the story, after all features a war that is already won by the “right side”.

In this vein, it makes some sense that, despite the novel being set far in the future, nuclear power dominates the struggle for power. Unlike World War 2, the protagonists of the story, the Foundation, begin the series with nuclear power. As a maintainer of scientific knowledge, it is a defining characteristic of the Foundation to have more advanced technology than its adversaries.

Foundation may then be viewed as a demonstration of the idea that science and technology can drive societal progress by providing those in power with a means to project control over the massses. Throughout the novel, the planets outside of the Foundation are often called "barbaric" for their lack of understanding regarding science and penchant towards warfare.

The Foundation exercises control over its neighbouring planets by exploiting their lack of nuclear technology. To provide an idea of the level of sophistication such technology entails roughly 50 years into Hari Seldon's 1000 year plan:
- The Foundation possesses nuclear power (whether this is fission or fusion, we do not know)
- Nuclear weapons still exist in the universe, but it is not clear what this entails.
