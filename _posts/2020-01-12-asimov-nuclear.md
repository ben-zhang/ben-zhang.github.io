Exerting political control using nuclear weaponry in Isaac Asimov's Foundation.

Recently, I released a blog post discussing my initial thoughts regarding Isaac Asimov's Foundation, discussing briefly about the use of nuclear technology in the novel. I'd like to dive deeper into this topic and think a little bit more about the **symbolism** of nuclear power and nuclear weapons in Foundation.

## Materialist Symbolism
Before I start discussing symbolism, I think it's important to explore the specific kind of symbolism that Asimov employs in Foundation. **Materialism** is a specific kind of symbolism in which physically manifst objects are represent a more abstract concept, idea, or message.

Science fiction, as a genre, is particularly materialist. Adam Roberts, a literary critic, aptly describes the phenomenon in his book entitled _Science Fiction_ the following way:

"\[Science Fiction\] gives us a unique version of the symbolist approach, one where the symbol is drained of transcendental or metaphysical aura and relocated back in the material world."

Unlike other genres of texts (in the Bakhtinian sense ;D), symbols in science fiction tend to be very physically manifest. In Foundation, one particularly prominent symbol is nuclear technology.

## Nukes as Symbols in Foundation
No matter which era in the five Foundation unit texts, the incumbent leader of the Foundation establishes power over the surrounding territories using nuclear power. 

What does this mean?
