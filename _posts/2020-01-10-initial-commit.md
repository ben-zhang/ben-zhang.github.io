I've decided to start a blog. 

Why, you may ask?

Recently, I enrolled in ENGL208B: Science Fiction Literature, a course that discusses the nature of Science Fiction (or SF, for short) and its impact on society. This course has an extensive reading list featuring many well-known SF authors, including H.G. Wells and Isaac Asimov, among many others. Lacking the motivation to read through all of these books, I decided to blog about them. 

Aside from posts regarding my progress in books, you'll perhaps also find the occasional page of course notes and a few synopses of research papers as I explore the many new things I can do with my brand new blog.
